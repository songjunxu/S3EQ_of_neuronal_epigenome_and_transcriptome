### Key points
  * S3EQ enabled epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis from a single sample
  *	ChIP-S3EQ reliably identified hPTM enrichment in the adult mouse NAc with high precision
  *	Spliceosome of whole cell RNA-seq was closely recapitulated by cytosolic RNA-S3EQ
  *	S3EQ showed increased sensitivity for correlating chromatin modifications with gene expression
